* ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§
 - Have tested all instructions for 6502 with test sets from [[https://github.com/SingleStepTests/65x02][this repo.]]. All test cases pass.
 - Have not implemented the unofficial opcodes for nes. Will get to them, after the everything else is set.

this project is to learn harware emulation. I chose NES, because it has some of my favorite games. Any suggestions to improve the code are welcome.
