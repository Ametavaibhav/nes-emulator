* ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§
 - Have tested all instructions for 6502 with test sets from [[https://github.com/SingleStepTests/65x02][this repo.]]. All test cases pass.
 - The snake-test runs fine. Code for the snake game taken from [[https://gist.github.com/wkjagt/9043907][here]]. Run ~./tests/snake_test.py~.
 - Have not implemented the unofficial opcodes for nes. Will get to them, after the everything else is set.

This project is to learn hardware emulation. I chose NES, because it has some of my favorite games. Any suggestions to improve the project are welcome.
